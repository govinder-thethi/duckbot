"The duck is a number of species in the Anatidae family of birds. They are related to swans and geese."
,
"Ducks are mostly aquatic birds living in both fresh water and sea water and found on every continent except for Antarctica."
,
"A male duck is called a drake, a female duck a hen, and a baby duck a duckling."
,
"Ducks are omnivores. They feed on aquatic plants, small fish, insects, worms, grubs and more. People often feed domesticated ducks bread."
,
"Diving ducks and sea ducks search for food fairly deep underwater. To be able to stay underwater more easily, diving ducks are quite heavy."
,
"Dabbling ducks feed on the surface of water, on land, or by ducking their head underwater. Along the edge of their beak is a comb-like structure called a pecten, that enables them to hold slippery food and filter nutrients out of the water."
,
"A common urban legend is that a ducks quack does not echo. This has however, been proven to be false."
,
"Ducks are curious and friendly creatures they have been domesticated as pets and farm animals for more than 500 years. All domestic ducks are descended from either the Mallard or the Muscovy duck."
,
"The most common and recognised species of duck is the Mallard or Wild duck. It is a dabbling duck that lives in the Americas, Europe, Asia, North Africa, and has been introduced to New Zealand and Australia."
,
"The male Mallard has a glossy green head, grey wings and belly, while the female has a brown-speckled plumage. Mallard ducks have a moulting season, they are vulnerable during this time as the moulting stops them flying."
,
"Mallard ducks live 5 to 10 years in the wild and 8+ years in captivity."
,
"Paradise Shelducks of New Zealand often have one mating partner for life."
,
"All ducks have highly waterproof feathers due to the feathers interlocking nature and waxy coating."
,
"Ducks have many economic uses. Their feathers, particularly their underlying 'down' feathers, are used in many products, while the white Pekin duck is the most common variety raised for eggs and meat."
,
"Ducks have featured as popular cartoon characters over the years, such as Walt Disneys Donald Duck and Warner Brothers, Daffy Duck."
,
"Ducks can live up to 20 years, depending on the species and if well cared for."
,
"The production of eggs is affected by daylight. When there is more daylight, the ducks will lay more eggs. "
,
"The eggs will hatch within 28 days, except for the Muscovy duck which takes about 35 days to hatch. The mother duck will keep her brood of ducklings together to protect them from predators."
,
"Ducks are outgoing, social animals who feel most at ease when theyre in a larger group of other ducks."
,
"Ducklings younger than 10 days tend to swim and walk as a group, always close to their mother, to avoid the attack of predators."
"Their webbed feet have no nerves or blood vessels, rendering them incapable of feeling the cold."
,
"After a male duck, or drake's, chosen mate is hatching eggs, the birds undergo molting, temporarily losing their bright plumage, as well as their ability to fly."
'
"Ducks have three eyelids and can see in color."
,
"Because a duck's eyes are located on either sides of its head, they have a field of vision of nearly 340 degrees."
,
"Very rarely, a severe weather event will trigger a mass migration known as a 'grand passage' There have been only three recorded instances of grand passages: one in 1940, one in 1955, and the most recent in 1995,
when a reported 90 million waterfowl migrated from Canada after a severe cold front set in, causing major problems at airports along the birds' route."
,
"Mallard ducks stay alert even when they doze. While snoozing in groups, the ducks stationed as 'guards' on the outside sleep with one eye—generally the eye facing away from the group—open.
In doing so, they control which side of the brain stays awake."
